This is a customizable news feed web application. Users can personalize their news portal based on their interests. Additionally, news articles are categorized into prominent sections such as Technology and Health, and the latest news is made publicly accessible.

The application integrates the News API as its news source. The frontend is developed using React, while the backend is built with Node.js. MongoDB is used as the user database. User registration, authentication, and API integrations are implemented securely.
